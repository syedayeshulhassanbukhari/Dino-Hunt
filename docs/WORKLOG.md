## 2026-09-05 — Spec review, place survey, repo set up

**Nothing in the Roblox place was modified.** This session was read-only against Studio.

### Done

- **Reviewed the MVP design document** (v1.1, 26 Aug 2026, 14 sections). Found 7 critical
  problems, 4 balance issues and 6 undefined states. Written up in
  [01-gdd-review.md](01-gdd-review.md).
  - Headline: the pacing budget overruns its own 28-38 min target by its own numbers
    (34.3-45.5 min), and all three currencies have no values at all.
- **Verified the Studio MCP bridge.** One instance attached: Dino Valley, placeId
  `88638180383535`, Edit mode.
- **Surveyed the place** and discovered it is not empty — it runs a complete Area 51
  alien/zombie wave shooter with ~50 server scripts, a 13-module enemy AI package, a 27-gun
  weapon framework and a 300-wave table. Mapped every spec system onto it in
  [02-conversion-map.md](02-conversion-map.md): **4 reuse, 7 extend, 4 build new**.
- **Raised 4 blocking decisions** in [03-open-decisions.md](03-open-decisions.md), and
  recorded the 4 already settled.
- **Initialised this repo** with README, CLAUDE.md and docs.

### Decided this session

- Build target is the Dino Valley place.
- Approach is reskin in place, incrementally — not a fork, not greenfield.
- Map the existing systems before writing any code.

### Blocked on

- **D-01** match shape (300 endless vs 20 finite) and **D-02** wave table ownership. Both
  block all wave work.
- Push to GitHub — the remote `syedayeshulhassanbukhari/Dino-Hunt` returns "not found"
  (private and unauthenticated, or not yet created), and this machine has no `gh` CLI and no
  git credential helper configured.

### Next

Settle D-01 through D-04, then fork the wave pipeline to a finite 20-wave table.
